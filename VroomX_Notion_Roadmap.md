## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### 🔴 High Risk: AI Cost Overruns
**Risk:** Heavy AI users could cost $4-5/month instead of $0.25

**Mitigation:**
- Implement rate limits (100 queries/month for Solo)
- Use GPT-4o-mini for 80% of queries
- Cache common regulation lookups
- Show "AI credits remaining" to users

### 🟡 Medium Risk: Competitor Response
**Risk:** Tenstreet or Foley adds AI features

**Mitigation:**
- Move fast - ship features weekly
- Build community/brand loyalty
- Focus on small carriers they ignore
- Keep pricing disruptive

### 🟡 Medium Risk: Slow Customer Acquisition
**Risk:** Truckers slow to adopt new software

**Mitigation:**
- Free CSA checker builds trust first
- Partner with consultants they already trust
- Show ROI: "Prevent $11,956 DQF violation"
- Offer white-glove onboarding
