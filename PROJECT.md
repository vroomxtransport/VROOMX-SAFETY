  - Root cause: ThemeContext applies `dark` class based on OS preference, but public pages (Landing, Pricing) use hardcoded light colors that don't respond to dark class
  - Fix: Added `useEffect` hook to force light mode on public pages by removing `dark` class on mount
  - Files: `frontend/src/pages/Landing.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/Pricing.jsx`
- **Fix:** companyId reference error in FMCSA routes
  - File: `backend/routes/fmcsa.js`

- **Feature:** Added Clearinghouse Expiry, MVR Due Date, and Hire Date columns to drivers list
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/Drivers.jsx`
- **Dependency:** Added lodash for search debounce functionality

### 2026-01-28 (Standalone Pricing Page)
- **Feature:** Created standalone Pricing page at `/pricing`
  - 3 pricing tiers: Solo ($19/mo), Fleet ($39/mo), Pro ($89/mo)
  - Feature comparison matrix
  - FAQ accordion with billing questions
  - Trust badges (FMCSA compliance, SSL secured, 99.9% uptime)
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/Pricing.jsx`
- **UI:** Updated "Get Started" header button to navigate to `/pricing` instead of scrolling to pricing section
- **Fix:** Blurry text on CSA Score Analyzer section

### 2026-01-28 (5 UX Bug Fixes)
- **Fix:** Search functionality improvements with debounce
- **Fix:** Notifications display issues
- **Fix:** FMCSA sync error handling
- **Fix:** Vehicle and driver detail views
- Files: Multiple frontend components

### 2026-01-28 (Admin Panel & Compliance Improvements)
- **Feature:** Data Integrity Monitor in Admin Panel
  - Identifies data inconsistencies across the system
  - File: Admin panel routes and components
- **UI:** Improved sidebar section header visibility
  - File: `frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx`
- **Fix:** Object.entries errors on Compliance page when data is null/undefined
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/Compliance.jsx`

### 2026-01-28 (CSA Scoring & Dashboard)
- **Feature:** Improved CSA scoring with FMCSA methodology
  - Real vs Estimated indicators for score accuracy
  - Better threshold calculations
  - File: `frontend/src/components/CSATrends.jsx`, related services
- **Fix:** Dashboard metrics sync — 5 major fixes
  - Corrected data aggregation for compliance metrics
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`, backend routes
- **Fix:** VIN validation now accepts 16-17 characters (was strictly 17)
  - Some older vehicles have 16-character VINs
  - File: `backend/models/Vehicle.js`
- **Fix:** Vehicle details not showing in profile view
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/Vehicles.jsx`

### 2026-01-28 (In-App Plan Upgrade with Stripe Proration)
- **Feature:** Users can upgrade subscription plans (Solo→Fleet, Solo→Pro, Fleet→Pro) directly from the Billing page with automatic Stripe proration
  - Backend: Added `previewUpgrade()` using `stripe.invoices.createPreview()` and `upgradePlan()` using `stripe.subscriptions.update()` with `proration_behavior: 'create_prorations'`
  - Routes: `POST /api/billing/preview-upgrade` (returns prorated charge preview) and `POST /api/billing/upgrade` (executes the upgrade)
  - Frontend: Plan card buttons now show "Upgrade to Fleet/Pro" when on a lower plan. Confirmation modal displays current plan, new plan, prorated charge today, and new monthly price
  - Existing `customer.subscription.updated` webhook handler syncs plan changes automatically
  - Files: `backend/services/stripeService.js`, `backend/routes/billing.js`, `frontend/src/utils/api.js`, `frontend/src/pages/Billing.jsx`

### 2026-01-28 (Audit Follow-Up — JWT Cookie Migration + 3 Fixes)
- **Security:** Migrated JWT authentication from localStorage to httpOnly cookies. Eliminates XSS token theft vector.
  - Backend: Added `cookie-parser` middleware, `setTokenCookie()` helper sets httpOnly/secure/sameSite cookie on login, register, password update, company switch, and admin impersonate. Added `POST /api/auth/logout` to clear cookie. Auth middleware checks `req.cookies.token` first, falls back to `Authorization` header.
  - Frontend: Axios instance uses `withCredentials: true` (sends cookies automatically). Removed localStorage token storage, request interceptor, and Authorization header management. AuthContext validates session via `GET /api/auth/me` on mount.
  - Files: `backend/server.js`, `backend/middleware/auth.js`, `backend/routes/auth.js`, `backend/routes/companies.js`, `backend/routes/admin.js`, `frontend/src/utils/api.js`, `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
- **Security:** Added `checkPermission('dashboard', 'edit')` to 6 remaining unprotected dashboard write routes: `/refresh-fmcsa`, `/alerts/:id/dismiss`, `/alerts/:id/resolve`, `/alerts/escalate`, `/alerts/dismiss-bulk`, `/compliance-score/calculate`.
  - File: `backend/routes/dashboard.js`
- **Security:** Added `escapeRegex()` to checklists search endpoint (was missed in prior fix).
  - File: `backend/routes/checklists.js`
- **Fix:** Document download UI now uses authenticated download endpoint instead of direct `fileUrl`. Added `downloadDocument()` helper with blob fetch and browser download trigger.
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/Documents.jsx`

### 2026-01-28 (Static Analysis Audit Remediation — 9 Fixes)
- **Security:** Fixed tenant isolation — replaced 44 occurrences of legacy `req.user.companyId._id || req.user.companyId` with `req.companyFilter.companyId` across 13 route files. Prevents multi-company users from writing data to stale/wrong company.
  - Files: `drivers.js`, `documents.js`, `vehicles.js`, `accidents.js`, `violations.js`, `damageClaims.js`, `drugAlcohol.js`, `tickets.js`, `inspections.js`, `dashboard.js`, `reports.js`, `csa.js`, `templates.js`
- **Security:** Added `checkPermission()` middleware to all previously unprotected endpoints in tasks (10 routes), maintenance (14 routes), checklists (12 routes), and dashboard write endpoints (2 routes). Enforces role-based access control.
  - Files: `backend/routes/tasks.js`, `backend/routes/maintenance.js`, `backend/routes/checklists.js`, `backend/routes/dashboard.js`
- **Security:** Added field whitelists (`allowedFields` pattern) to prevent mass assignment in POST create and PUT update endpoints. Only explicitly listed fields are accepted from `req.body`.
  - Files: `backend/routes/vehicles.js`, `backend/routes/tasks.js`, `backend/routes/accidents.js`, `backend/routes/violations.js`, `backend/routes/documents.js` (PUT only, POST already whitelisted)
- **Security:** Added `escapeRegex()` to tasks.js and maintenance.js search endpoints to prevent regex DoS/injection. Drivers, vehicles, documents already had this fix.
  - Files: `backend/routes/tasks.js`, `backend/routes/maintenance.js`
- **Security:** Deleted `VROOMX-SAFETY.env` from disk (contained production secrets). File was never committed to git (`.gitignore` `*.env` pattern covered it).
- **Feature:** Created authenticated document download route `GET /api/documents/:id/download` with company-scoped access control, file streaming, and proper Content-Type headers. Replaces direct `fileUrl` access pattern.
  - File: `backend/routes/documents.js`
- **Fix:** Audit log company attribution now uses `req.companyFilter?.companyId` (middleware-validated) as primary source instead of searching user's companies array. Falls back gracefully for admin-panel routes.
  - File: `backend/services/auditService.js`
- **Fix:** In-memory rate limit Maps in AI and CSA Checker routes now have periodic cleanup (every 5 minutes) to prevent unbounded memory growth.
  - Files: `backend/routes/ai.js`, `backend/routes/csaChecker.js`
- **Fix:** Subscription limits virtual now correctly maps `solo`, `fleet`, `pro` plans (replaced stale `starter`/`professional` mappings). Paying users were incorrectly falling back to `free_trial` limits.
  - File: `backend/models/User.js`

### 2026-01-28 (UI Changes — Driver/Vehicle Forms, CSA Charts, Archives)
- **UI:** Moved 24-Month Score Projection chart from CSA Estimator and Compliance Overview tab into the Score Trends module (CSATrends.jsx). Cleaned up unused imports and state from source files.
  - Files: `frontend/src/pages/CSAEstimator.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/Compliance.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/CSATrends.jsx`
- **UI:** Moved "Welcome back!" toast notification into AI Chat panel as a system welcome message
  - Files: `frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/AIChat/ChatWidget.jsx`
- **Feature:** Driver form overhaul — removed Employee ID (now optional), added: Driver Type (Company Driver / Owner-Operator), Address (street/city/state/zip), CDL Endorsements (multi-checkbox: H/N/P/S/T/X), CDL Restrictions (comma-separated text), MVR Expiry Date, Clearinghouse Expiry Date, Termination Date (shown only for terminated drivers)
  - Files: `backend/models/Driver.js`, `backend/routes/drivers.js`, `frontend/src/pages/Drivers.jsx`
- **Feature:** Driver Archive system — terminated drivers auto-archive with 3-year DQF retention countdown. "Archived" tab on Drivers page shows terminated drivers with "Can be deleted after MM/DD/YYYY" or "Safe to delete" badges. Restore button to unarchive.
  - Backend: `isArchived`, `archivedAt`, `retentionExpiresAt` fields, pre-save hook on status→terminated, `PATCH /api/drivers/:id/restore` endpoint, `?archived=true` query filter
  - Frontend: Active/Archived tab bar, archived table with retention info, restore handler
  - Files: `backend/models/Driver.js`, `backend/routes/drivers.js`, `frontend/src/pages/Drivers.jsx`
- **Feature:** Vehicle form expansion — added: Color, GVWR, Tire Size, Ownership (Owned/Leased/Financed), IFTA Decal #, Date Added to Fleet, Date Removed from Fleet, Cab Card Expiry, Annual Expiry
  - Files: `backend/models/Vehicle.js`, `frontend/src/pages/Vehicles.jsx`

### 2026-01-28 (Secret Rotation & Env Var Verification)
- **Security:** Rotated MongoDB Atlas password (`info_db_user`) — new password generated, `MONGODB_URI` updated in Render
- **Security:** Rotated OpenAI API key — new key created, old key deleted, `OPENAI_API_KEY` updated in Render
- **Security:** Rotated Resend API key — new key created, old key deleted, `RESEND_API_KEY` updated in Render
- **Verified:** All 13 production env vars confirmed set in Render dashboard (`NODE_ENV`, `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_SOLO_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_FLEET_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- **Verified:** `.env` never committed to git history — BFG purge not needed
- **Verified:** Post-redeploy health check passed — `{"status":"healthy","database":"connected"}` with 36s uptime

### 2026-01-28 (MVP Hardening — Tier 0+1 Deployment Fixes)
- **Security:** Changed JWT expiry from 7d to 1h in `render.yaml`
  - File: `render.yaml`
- **Security:** Added production env var validation at startup — server exits with clear error if missing: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_SOLO_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_FLEET_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `FRONTEND_URL`
  - File: `backend/server.js`
- **Security:** Added weak JWT_SECRET length warning (< 32 chars)
  - File: `backend/server.js`
- **Stability:** Added `process.on('uncaughtException')` handler — logs + exits in production
- **Stability:** Updated `process.on('unhandledRejection')` — now exits in production (was log-only)
  - File: `backend/server.js`
- **Stability:** Health check (`/health`) now pings MongoDB and returns DB status; returns 503 if disconnected
  - File: `backend/server.js`
- **Fix:** Driver/vehicle creation race condition — wrapped in MongoDB transactions (`session.startTransaction` → `countDocuments` → `create` → `commit`) to prevent subscription limit bypass via concurrent requests
  - Files: `backend/routes/drivers.js`, `backend/routes/vehicles.js`
  - Added race condition warning comments to: `backend/middleware/subscriptionLimits.js`
- **Cleanup:** Removed ~45 debug `console.log` statements from 9 backend files (sensitive data like webhook events, price IDs, user IDs, DOT sync data)
  - Files: `stripeService.js` (13), `admin.js` (4), `fmcsaSyncService.js` (9), `fmcsaService.js` (12), `alertService.js` (2), `csaAlertService.js` (1), `emailService.js` (3), `dashboard.js` (1), `auth.js` (1)
- **UX:** Created `ErrorBoundary.jsx` — React class component catching render errors with dark-themed fallback UI, "Try Again" and "Reload Page" buttons. Wrapped `<App />` in ErrorBoundary.
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx` (new), `frontend/src/main.jsx`
- **UX:** Created `NotFound.jsx` — 404 page with "Go Home" and "Go to Dashboard" links. Replaced catch-all redirect with proper 404 page.
  - Files: `frontend/src/pages/NotFound.jsx` (new), `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- **UX:** Created `ConfirmDialog.jsx` — reusable modal replacing browser `confirm()`. Supports danger/warning/info variants. Migrated Billing.jsx cancel subscription flow.
  - Files: `frontend/src/components/ConfirmDialog.jsx` (new), `frontend/src/pages/Billing.jsx`
- **Fix:** Added 15-second Axios request timeout to prevent indefinite hangs
  - File: `frontend/src/utils/api.js`
- **Docs:** Added dev-only comment to Vite proxy config
  - File: `frontend/vite.config.js`
- **Analysis:** Updated `roadmap.html` competitive landscape — replaced 16 broad competitors with 7 focused (VroomX + 4 direct competitors + Samsara/Motive/J.J. Keller for context). Added Direct Competitors Deep Dive section with DOTDriverFiles, FleetDrive360, My Safety Manager, AvatarFleet profiles. Updated feature matrix and gap analysis.
  - File: `roadmap.html`

### 2026-01-27 (Maintenance AI Smart Upload Fix)
- **Fix:** AI smart upload not extracting data from PDF invoices — maintenance form fields stayed empty after upload
  - Root cause: `extractMaintenanceData()` used OpenAI Chat Completions API with `image_url` content type, which only supports images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP). PDF invoices sent as `data:application/pdf;base64,...` were rejected by OpenAI.
  - Fix: Added PDF detection — PDFs now use OpenAI Responses API (`openai.responses.create()`) with `input_file` content type. Images continue using the existing Chat Completions `image_url` approach.
  - File: `backend/services/openaiVisionService.js`
- **Fix:** Moved `POST /smart-upload` route before parameterized `/:id` routes in Express — best practice to prevent route matching conflicts
  - File: `backend/routes/maintenance.js`
- **Fix:** Silent failure when AI extraction fails — user saw no feedback. Now shows error toast: "Could not extract data from document. Please fill in details manually."
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/Maintenance.jsx`

### 2026-01-27 (Dashboard Layout)
- **UI:** Compacted Compliance Score card — reduced gauge from 224px to 160px, score text from 6xl to 5xl, tightened padding/margins throughout
- **UI:** Moved Compliance Trend chart from middle of dashboard to bottom (after alerts/birthdays/status row)
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

### 2026-01-27 (Admin Panel Overhaul)
- **Feature:** Comprehensive admin panel overhaul with analytics, power tools, and system operations
  - **Backend — New Models:** `Announcement.js` (message, type, dates, audience), `FeatureFlag.js` (key, description, enabled), `SystemConfig.js` (key-value store with static helpers)
  - **Backend — Maintenance Middleware:** `backend/middleware/maintenance.js` — checks SystemConfig for `maintenance_mode`, returns 503 for non-admin requests, caches 30s, superadmins bypass via JWT peek, `bustCache()` export
  - **Backend — Public Routes:** `backend/routes/announcements.js` (GET active), `backend/routes/features.js` (GET active flag keys)
  - **Backend — Admin Endpoints (~20 new):**
    - Analytics: `GET /api/admin/analytics` (signups, active users, MRR, churn, top companies via aggregation)
    - User tools: `POST /users`, `POST /users/bulk` (suspend/unsuspend/delete, max 50), `POST /users/:id/force-reset`, `GET /users/:id/login-history`, `GET /users/:id/audit-log`
    - Company tools: `PATCH /companies/:id` (DOT blocked), `DELETE /companies/:companyId/members/:userId`, `PATCH /companies/:companyId/members/:userId`
    - System: `GET /system` (DB, uptime, memory, services), `GET /emails` (paginated), `GET /emails/:id`, `GET /emails/stats`
    - Announcements CRUD + toggle, Feature Flags CRUD + toggle, Maintenance get/set
  - **Frontend — New Components:** `AnalyticsCharts.jsx`, `UserDetailDrawer.jsx`, `AdminEmails.jsx`, `AdminAnnouncements.jsx`, `AdminFeatureFlags.jsx`, `AnnouncementBanner.jsx`, `MaintenancePage.jsx`, `FeatureFlagContext.jsx`
  - **Frontend — Enhanced Pages:** AdminDashboard (analytics + system health + maintenance toggle), AdminUsers (add user, bulk actions, force reset, checkbox selection, detail drawer), AdminCompanies (edit modal, status toggle, member role/removal)
  - **Frontend — Wiring:** 25+ new adminAPI methods, announcementsAPI export, 503 maintenance interceptor, 3 new admin routes, FeatureFlagProvider wrapping, AnnouncementBanner in Layout
  - Files modified: 26 files, 3,927 lines added
- **Fix:** Feature flags page crash — `TypeError: t.map is not a function` because frontend read `response.data.flags` but backend returns `response.data.features`
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminFeatureFlags.jsx`
- **Fix:** System Health panel showing all red dots, "Unknown" database, "N/A" uptime/memory — 3 bugs:
  1. Data nesting mismatch: frontend stored `response.data` but needed `response.data.system`
  2. Service key mismatch: frontend used `email` but backend returns `resend`; also checked `.status === 'operational'` but backend returns booleans
  3. Missing emailStats: backend `/admin/system` didn't include email counts — added sent/delivered/failed (24h)
  - Files: `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx`, `backend/routes/admin.js`

### 2026-01-27 (Stripe Webhook Fix)
- **Fix:** Stripe webhooks failing (8/8 failed) — subscriptions not updating after payment
  - Root cause: `express.json()` middleware parsed the request body before the webhook route's `express.raw()` could capture it. Stripe's `constructEvent()` needs the raw Buffer for HMAC signature verification, but received a parsed JS object instead → signature verification failed → all webhooks rejected → subscription never synced to MongoDB
  - Fix: Skip `express.json()` for `/api/billing/webhook` path so `express.raw()` in the billing route can capture the raw body
  - File: `backend/server.js`
- **Fix:** Manually synced test user `safety@horizonstartransport.com` subscription from `free_trial` to `solo/active` in MongoDB after confirming Stripe charge went through

### 2026-01-27 (Audit Log & Rate Limiting)
- **Feature:** Full audit log system with route instrumentation across all API endpoints
  - New files: `backend/models/AuditLog.js`, `backend/services/auditService.js`, `backend/routes/audit.js`
  - New frontend: `frontend/src/components/settings/AuditLogTab.jsx` — company-scoped audit log tab in Settings (admin/owner only) with CSV export
  - Instrumented all routes: auth, admin, companies, billing, drivers, vehicles, violations, documents, drugAlcohol, accidents, tickets, damageClaims, maintenance, tasks, checklists
  - Registered in: `backend/routes/index.js`, `backend/models/index.js`, `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx`
- **Fix:** Auth rate limiter blocked all emails when one email hit the limit — was keyed on IP only
  - Changed `keyGenerator` to `${req.ip}:${email}` so rate limiting is per-IP-per-email
  - File: `backend/server.js`
- **Feature:** Rate limit countdown timer on login page
  - Shows exact time remaining when rate limited (reads `RateLimit-Reset` header)
  - Live countdown display with disabled button showing "Locked (MM:SS)"
  - Added CORS `exposedHeaders` for rate limit headers
  - Files: `frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`, `backend/server.js`
- **Fix:** Generic password validation error on reset-password page — now shows specific validation message
  - File: `backend/routes/auth.js`
- **Feature:** Password reset confirmation email sent after successful reset
  - File: `backend/routes/auth.js`, `backend/services/emailService.js`

### 2026-01-27 (Production Fixes & Email Testing)
- **Fix:** Added `trust proxy` setting for Render deployment — `express-rate-limit` was throwing `ERR_ERL_UNEXPECTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR` on every request because Render's reverse proxy sets `X-Forwarded-For` but Express wasn't configured to trust it
  - File: `backend/server.js`
- **Fix:** Corrected production backend URL in PROJECT.md from `vroomx-safety-api.onrender.com` to `vroomx-safety.onrender.com`
- **Fix:** EmailLog missing required `from` field — all audit log writes were silently failing (Mongoose validation error caught but not visible). Added `from: FROM` to both success and failure log paths.
  - File: `backend/services/emailService.js`
- **Fix:** Resend SDK v2 error handling — SDK returns `{ data, error }` without throwing. Code was logging failed sends as "sent". Added `result.error` check to properly detect and log Resend rejections.
  - File: `backend/services/emailService.js`
- **Fix:** `sendReport()` null attachment — report email route passes `null` for PDF buffer, but `sendReport()` always attached it. Resend silently rejected the null attachment. Now skips attachment when `pdfBuffer` is null.
  - File: `backend/services/emailService.js`
- **Infra:** Added `RESEND_API_KEY` to Render environment variables — emails were silently skipped without it

#### Email System Test Results (2026-01-27)

All 6 testable email types verified on production with real Resend delivery:

| Email Type | Template | Status | Delivery Confirmed |
|------------|----------|--------|--------------------|
| Welcome | welcome | SENT | Yes |
| Email Verification | email-verification | SENT | Yes |
| Password Reset | password-reset | SENT | Yes |
| Company Invitation | company-invitation | SENT | Yes |
| Compliance Alert Digest | compliance-alert-digest | SENT | Yes |
| Report Email | report | SENT | Yes |

**Not tested (require external triggers):**
- Payment Success / Payment Failed — requires Stripe webhook events (will trigger on real payments)
- Trial Ending — requires user with trial ending in 2-3 days (cron runs at 9 AM daily)

**EmailLog audit trail:** All sent emails now properly logged with Resend message IDs in the `emaillogs` MongoDB collection.

### 2025-01-26
- **Limits:** Restricted free trial to 1 driver, 1 vehicle, 1 company (was 3/3/1)
  - Files: `backend/middleware/subscriptionLimits.js`, `backend/models/User.js`
  - Users on trial must subscribe to add more resources
- **UI:** Changed "Start Free Trial" to "Subscribe" on Billing page plan buttons
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/Billing.jsx`
  - Affected: Solo, Fleet, and Pro plan cards
- **Fix:** React Error #31 in BillingTab.jsx - Objects were being rendered directly instead of accessing nested properties (`.owned`, `.current`)
  - File: `frontend/src/components/settings/BillingTab.jsx`
  - Lines 48, 60, 72: Changed `currentUsage?.companies` to `currentUsage?.companies?.owned`, etc.
- **Added:** PROJECT.md - Comprehensive project documentation

### 2026-01-27 (Email System Completion)
- **Feature:** Added 3 missing frontend pages for email token flows
  - `frontend/src/pages/VerifyEmail.jsx` — handles `/verify-email?token=xxx` from verification emails
  - `frontend/src/pages/ResetPassword.jsx` — handles `/reset-password?token=xxx` from password reset emails
  - `frontend/src/pages/AcceptInvitation.jsx` — handles `/accept-invitation?token=xxx` from company invite emails
- **Feature:** "Forgot password?" link on Login page — sends reset email inline
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`
- **Fix:** Email preferences field name mismatch — NotificationsTab was sending camelCase keys (`complianceAlerts`) but backend expects snake_case (`compliance_alerts`). Now aligned.
  - File: `frontend/src/components/settings/NotificationsTab.jsx`
- **Added:** API client methods for `forgotPassword`, `resetPassword`, `verifyEmail`
  - File: `frontend/src/utils/api.js`
- **Added:** Routes in App.jsx for verify-email, reset-password, accept-invitation
  - File: `frontend/src/App.jsx`

### 2026-01-27 (Google Workspace Email)
- **Infra:** Connected `vroomxsafety.com` domain to Google Workspace
  - Admin email: `admin@vroomxsafety.com`
  - Resend domain verified for transactional email delivery
  - Recommended aliases: `noreply@vroomxsafety.com` (FROM), `support@vroomxsafety.com` (REPLY_TO)

### 2026-01-27 (Email Notification System)
- **Feature:** Full email notification system using Resend SDK
  - New files: `backend/services/emailService.js`, `backend/models/EmailLog.js`, 10 HTML templates in `backend/templates/`
  - 9 email types: welcome, email verification, password reset, payment success/failure, trial ending, company invitation, compliance alert digest, report email
  - Branded HTML templates with VroomX Safety navy/orange theme, inline CSS for email client compatibility
  - Fire-and-forget pattern — emails never block app flow
  - Graceful degradation — works without Resend API key configured
  - EmailLog model for audit trail (tracks every send with Resend message ID)
  - User email preferences (compliance_alerts, billing, reports, product_updates)
  - New auth routes: forgot-password, reset-password, verify-email, email-preferences
  - Wired into: registration (welcome + verification), Stripe webhooks (payment success/failure), company invitations, daily 6 AM alert digest cron, 9 AM trial ending cron, report email route
  - Frontend: NotificationsTab in Settings with toggle switches per category
  - Modified files: `auth.js`, `stripeService.js`, `companies.js`, `server.js`, `reports.js`, `Settings.jsx`, `api.js`
  - Package: `resend` added to backend

### 2026-01-27 (Bug Fixes & Polish)
- **Fix:** Restored `database.js` crash-on-failure behavior - was silently continuing without MongoDB connection
  - File: `backend/config/database.js`
- **Fix:** Accidents route using wrong permission module (`violations` instead of `accidents`) across all 6 handlers
  - File: `backend/routes/accidents.js`
- **Fix:** Dynamic Tailwind classes on Landing page badges not compiling (`bg-${var}-50` pattern)
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/Landing.jsx` - replaced with static class maps
- **Fix:** Auth redirect pointing to `/dashboard` instead of `/app/dashboard`
  - File: `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- **Cleanup:** Removed 35 console.log/console.error statements leaking debug info in production
  - Files: 16 frontend files (AuthContext, Reports, Register, Tickets, Tasks, Maintenance, CSAEstimator, DrugAlcohol, Settings, Documents, Accidents, AlertsDashboard, Violations, Checklists, DamageClaims, CompanySwitcher)
- **Polish:** Search input now responsive (`w-40 lg:w-64` instead of fixed `w-64`)
  - File: `frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx`
- **A11y:** Added ARIA labels to search input and notifications button
  - File: `frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx`
- **Docs:** Updated `.env.example` with 11 missing production variables (Stripe, AI, JWT refresh, frontend URL)
  - File: `backend/.env.example`

### 2026-01-26
- **Fix:** Free trial usage display showed ∞ instead of 1 for driver/vehicle limits
  - File: `backend/middleware/subscriptionLimits.js` (lines 234, 238)
  - Changed `plan === 'solo'` to `(plan === 'solo' || plan === 'free_trial')`
- **Security Audit:** Full-stack security audit performed (32 vulnerabilities found)
  - **7 CRITICAL:** Exposed credentials in .env, NoSQL injection via regex, unprotected seed endpoint, Puppeteer HTTPS bypass, XSS via dangerouslySetInnerHTML, JWT in localStorage, Stripe webhook validation
  - **12 HIGH:** Missing rate limiting, weak passwords, file upload path traversal, unauth file access, long JWT expiry, admin impersonation gaps, RBAC bypass, mass assignment, unhashed reset tokens, no email verification, no brute force protection, privilege escalation
  - **13 MEDIUM:** CORS config, incomplete Helmet, debug logs, error info leak, no magic bytes validation, SSN exposure, no HIPAA controls, no audit trail, subscription gaps, Morgan header logging, no CSRF, no data retention policy
  - **Full remediation applied** - all 15 code fixes implemented and verified

#### Security Fixes Applied (2026-01-26 / 2026-01-27)

**CRITICAL Fixes:**
1. **JWT Secret Rotated** - Replaced weak predictable secret with 128-char cryptographic hex string; reduced expiry from 7d to 1h
   - Files: `backend/.env`
2. **NoSQL Injection Fixed** - Added `escapeRegex()` to all search endpoints to prevent regex injection attacks
   - Files: `backend/routes/drivers.js`, `backend/routes/documents.js`, `backend/routes/vehicles.js`
3. **Seed Endpoint Protected** - Added `protect` + `requireSuperAdmin` middleware; blocked entirely in production
   - File: `backend/routes/seed.js`
4. **Puppeteer HTTPS Fixed** - `ignoreHTTPSErrors` now only `true` in development, `false` in production
   - File: `backend/services/fmcsaService.js`
5. **XSS Prevention** - Added DOMPurify sanitization for `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in blog content
   - File: `frontend/src/components/blog/ArticleModal.jsx`
   - Package added: `dompurify`
6. **Stripe Webhook Hardened** - Explicit `StripeSignatureVerificationError` handling; generic error messages
   - File: `backend/routes/billing.js`

**HIGH Fixes:**
7. **Rate Limiting Added** - Global: 200 req/15min on `/api`; Auth: 15 req/15min on login/register
   - File: `backend/server.js`
   - Package added: `express-rate-limit`
8. **Password Strength** - Now requires uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
   - File: `backend/models/User.js`
9. **File Upload Security** - Path traversal prevention, upload folder whitelist, MIME+extension validation, filename sanitization
   - File: `backend/middleware/upload.js`
10. **Static Uploads Removed** - `express.static('/uploads')` removed to prevent unauthorized file access
    - File: `backend/server.js`
11. **Admin Security** - Self-modification blocked, impersonation reduced to 30min, super admin impersonation blocked, audit logging added
    - File: `backend/routes/admin.js`
12. **Auth Middleware Hardened** - JWT algorithm restricted to HS256, legacy RBAC role fallback removed
    - File: `backend/middleware/auth.js`
13. **Mass Assignment Prevention** - Driver update endpoint now uses field whitelist; SSN excluded from detail views
    - File: `backend/routes/drivers.js`

**MEDIUM Fixes:**
14. **Debug Logs Removed** - Removed 4 console.log statements leaking subscription/registration info
    - File: `backend/routes/auth.js`
15. **Error Sanitization** - Duplicate key and validation errors use generic messages in production; 404 handler hides URL path in production
    - File: `backend/middleware/errorHandler.js`
16. **Server Hardening** - Full Helmet config (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options), CORS fails closed without FRONTEND_URL, env var validation at startup, custom Morgan format excludes auth headers
    - File: `backend/server.js`
