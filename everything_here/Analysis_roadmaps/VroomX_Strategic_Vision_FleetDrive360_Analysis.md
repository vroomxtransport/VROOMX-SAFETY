## ✅ SUMMARY: What to Steal from FleetDrive360

| Element | Steal? | How |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Safety Calendar | ✅ Yes | Free resource page |
| FAQ Page | ✅ Yes | Answer common questions |
| Partnership Page | ✅ Later | Show integrations |
| Affiliate Program | ✅ Later | 10-20% commission |
| Per-Driver Pricing | ❌ No | Your flat rate is better |
| New Authority Services | 🤔 Maybe | High margin but complex |
| Drug & Alcohol | ✅ Phase 3 | Partner with lab network |
| Clearinghouse | ✅ Phase 3 | Become C/TPA or partner |

---

## 🚀 YOUR UNIQUE ANGLE

**FleetDrive360 = Software + Services for Fleets**
**VroomX = Platform connecting Fleets with Safety Managers**

This is your differentiator. While they sell to fleets only, you can:
1. Sell to fleets (like they do)
2. Sell to safety managers (they don't)
3. Connect them via marketplace (they can't)

**The marketplace model is your path to scale without needing massive sales teams.**
